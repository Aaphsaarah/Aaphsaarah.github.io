Hey! I’m Aaphsaarah Rahman.  
     
A little background about myself - I’m a graduate student at [Cornell  University, Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), acquiring my Masters in Biostatistics and Data Science. I am a Data Enthusiast and my passion for Data Science has brought me here and I'm enjoying the ride tremendously. I did my undergrad in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), Bangladesh. I found my love for programming during my capstone project where I created a Brille Pad which had Text-to-Braille and Braille-to-Text capabilities with an integrated LCD Display. I have published and presented a paper based on this technology, titled “A Novel Braille Pad with Dual Text-to-Braille and Braille-to-Text Capabilities with an integrated LCD Display” in the 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT), Kerala, India, held on 6th -7th July 2017. I became adamant about pursuing my career in Data Science after doing my internship at [GrameenPhone Ltd](https://www.grameenphone.com/about), (Telenor Group) as a Data Analyst intern for Data Analyst and Research team under Business Intelligence department.   
   

Coding is fun, easy and adventurous once you get the gist of it. I love sharing open-source codes and providing helpful advice on it. These blogs and articles I shared provides interesting insights on various topics, which I discovered while doing a few personal projects. Hope you enjoy it!
