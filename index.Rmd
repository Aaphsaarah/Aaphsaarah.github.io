Hey!

I’m Aaphsaarah Rahman. A little background about myself - I’m a graduate student at Weill Cornell Medicine, acquiring my Masters in Biostatistics and Data Science. I did my undergrad in Electrical and Electrical Engineering at North South University, Bangladesh. I have published and presented a paper titled “A Novel Braille Pad with Dual Text-to-Braille and Braille-to-Text Capabilities with an integrated LCD Display” in the 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT), Kerala, India, held on 6th -7th July 2017. During this capstone project, I made a Braille Pad through which I found my love for programming. And after doing my internship at GrameenPhone Ltd. (Telenor Group) with Data Analyst and Research team, I was adamant to pursue my career in Data Science.   
   

Coding is fun, easy and adventurous once you get the gist of it. I love sharing open-source codes and providing advices on it. This blogs and articles are about sharing some interesting insights, which I explored while doing few projects. Hope you enjoy it!
