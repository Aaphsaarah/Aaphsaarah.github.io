AAPHSAARAH YOU have a webpage!

Hey!

I'm Aaphsaarah Rahman. A little background about myself. I'm a graduate student at Weill Cornell Medicine. Acquiring my Masters in Biostatistics and Data Science. I did my undergrad in Electrical and Electrical Engineering at North South University, Bangladesh. I have published and presented a paper titled “A Novel Braille Pad with Dual Text-to-Braille and Braille-to-Text capabilities with an integrated LCD Display” in the 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies (ICICICT), Kerala, India, held on 6th -7th July 2017. During this capstone project, I made a Braille Pad through which I found my love for programming. And after doing my internship at GrameenPhone Ltd.with Data Analyst and Research team I was adamant to pursue my career in Data Science.

Coding is fun, easy and adventurous once you get the gist of it. I love sharing open-source codes and giving advice. This blog is about sharing something interesting insights which I explored while doing a project. Hope this helps you too as well.
