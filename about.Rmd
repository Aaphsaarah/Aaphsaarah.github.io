Hey!
I'm Aaphsaarah Rahman. A little background about myself. I'm a graduate student at Weill Cornell Medicine. Aquiring my Masters in Biostas and Data Science. Coding is fun and is easy and adventurous once you get the gist of it. I love writting open source codes and giving tips. Hope you enjoy and find this helpful.

This blog is about sharing something interesting insights which I explored while doing a project. Hope this helps you too as well. 

Its focused to the audiences with little coding background.

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.
